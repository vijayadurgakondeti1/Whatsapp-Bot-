Image to ASCII Art Conversion: Implemented a feature allowing users to convert images to ASCII art. The script prompts the user for the image file path and converts the image to ASCII art using the pywhatkit library.
Technologies Used: Python, pywhatkit library.

Outcome: Created a versatile tool for WhatsApp automation and image manipulation. The project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming and the ability to integrate third-party libraries for practical applications.

Skills Demonstrated: Python programming, automation, user input handling, image processing, library integration.
